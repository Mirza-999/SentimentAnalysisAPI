## Sentiment Analysis API
This is a simple Sentiment Analysis API built using Gradio and VADER Sentiment Analysis. It classifies text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on sentiment scores.

## How It Works
Enter a text sentence in the input box.
The model analyzes sentiment using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
It returns one of the following results:
Positive (if sentiment is strong & positive)
Negative (if sentiment is strongly negative)
Neutral (if sentiment is mixed or neutral)

## Deployment on Hugging Face
